A journaling app built with Electron. Main purpose in this is to have a reason to learn Electron. Also, I'm guessing that it'll be much more motivating to keep a regular journal if I use my own software right?

Planned features include:
* Desktop notifications (reminders)
* Email entries as a backup
* Some sort of word analysis page
* Picture saving
* Audio saving
* Some sort of collage page made up of all the pictures
* Obviously basic journal data persistence
